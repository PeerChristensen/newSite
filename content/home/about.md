# About me

I'm a data scientist based in Copenhagen working on many exciting and diverse projects involving predictive analytics, segmentation and data visualisation.

I have a background in cognitive science investigating speech and gesture processing across languages and other aspects of behaviour and cognition.

I'm passionate about making sense of data and exploring new techniques. Here, I'll write some basic tutorials of various data science projects.
