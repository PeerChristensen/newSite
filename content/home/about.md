# About me

I'm a PhD student in psycholinguistics at Lund University. My research interests include speech and gesture processing across languages and other aspects of behaviour and cognition. I'm currently investigating whether spatial metaphors for musical pitch govern how we 'think' about differences in pitch.

Besides my actual work, I'm passionate about making sense of data using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques. Here, I'll write about some of my data science projects.
