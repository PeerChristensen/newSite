# About me

I'm a data scientist based in Copenhagen with a background in cognitive science and lingustics. I'm currently working on exciting and diverse projects often involving machine learning and natural language processing.

I haven't written new blog posts for a while, but I hope to add more content in the future.

Meanwhile, check out my new [portfolio](https://peerchristensenportfolio.netlify.app)
