# About me

I'm a data scientist based in Copenhagen with a background in cognitive science and lingustics. I'm working on exciting and diverse projects often involving machine learning and natural language processing.

I've decided not to update this site with new posts. Instead, you can find my recent articles on [Medium](https://peerchristensen.medium.com/)

You can also check out my shiny new [portfolio](https://peerchristensenportfolio.netlify.app)
