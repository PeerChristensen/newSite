      <description>Most people speak several languages and coordinate speech and gestures in language-specific ways. Yet we know very little about the processes that drive multimodal language use and learning. This project explores experimentally how adults manage the interaction between their languages - seen e.g. in foreign accent - using techniques such as motion capture, electrophysiology, and virtual reality.
Most people in the world speak several languages and often learn new languages in adulthood.</description>
